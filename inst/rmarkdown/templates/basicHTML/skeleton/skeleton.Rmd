# Introduction

R markdown allows to easily format your text. You can add [links](www.r-graph-gallery.com), write in **bold** or *italic*. This is very well explained in the [Rstudio cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

## Subsection Example
Inline LaTeX equations can be written in a pair of dollar signs using the LaTeX syntax, e.g., $f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$  math expressions of the display style can be written in a pair of double dollar signs, e.g., and the output looks like this: $$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$

### Sub-subsection example
Again sample text. 

### Example Table
```{r tables-mtcars, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(iris[1:5, ], caption = 'Table 1: Example Table Caption')
```

### Example Map
Below is a map that shows the location of the
Department of Statistics, Iowa State University.

```{r out.width='100%', echo=FALSE}
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
  setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17) %>%
  addPopups(
    -93.65, 42.0285,
    'Here is the <b>Department of Statistics</b>, ISU'
  )
```

#### Sub-sub-subsection Example
Example numbered and bulleted list:

1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item
    
Example blockquote

  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him

# Figure Captions

To set a figure caption and dimensions use the `fig.cap`, `fig.width`, and `fig.height` (in inches) in the chunk options section.

```{r fig, fig.cap = "Fig 1: MPG vs horsepower", fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```
